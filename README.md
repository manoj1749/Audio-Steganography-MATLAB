# Audio-Steganography-MATLAB

## Overview
Steganography is the art and science of hiding information in a way that the presence of the information itself is concealed. In the digital era, steganography has evolved to encompass various techniques, including audio steganography, which involves concealing secret data within audio files without raising suspicion.
The techniques of audio steganography are then explored, covering methods such as LSB substitution.
The presentation delves into the types of audio files commonly used for steganography, including WAV, MP3, FLAC, and AAC, highlighting considerations and challenges specific to each format. The embedding and extraction process is also elucidated, providing insights into how secret data can be embedded within an audio file and subsequently extracted.
## Goals
Create or generate a random noise signal
Encrypt text data in it
Decrypting the audio file and text data

## Tools used
### Matlab
- We are using matlab for this to run the code and see the audio spectrum and text file.
### Audacity
- Audacity used to play the .wav file

## Potential of the project in real life
1. Our project can be best used in military for sending sensitive data without getting detected to anyone.
2. Not only military but we can also save secret passwords.
3. By updating and deep research we can encrypt the text in movie songs etc.
4. Not only text we can also save images in audio signals and can be seen in  audi spectrogram
